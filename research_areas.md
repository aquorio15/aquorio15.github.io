Problems I am thinking about these days:  
## Theory: 
[1] Learning Accuracy Preserving Low Resource DNN Models    
[2] Manipulating the loss surface of DNNs  
[3] Low precision training




## NLP:
[1] Paraphrase Detection and Generation  
[2] Text Classification  
[3] Named Entity Recognition  


## Dialog Agents
[1] Dialog Simulation    
[2] Unsupervised Dialog Evaluation   
[3] User Behavior Model  
[4] Automated Crowdsourcing to collect Dialog Data   
[5] Annotator Model (Automated Annotation Model)
